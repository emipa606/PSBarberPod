    <description>After pushing the limit of research into the medical applications of plasteel scientists discovered something they never imagined possible, the technology to cut and color a personâ€™s hair. This modified cryptosleep casket is installed with a mechanical auto barber able to provide any patron with a new hair do. 
    
It also comes with a build in tanning bed and can be upgraded to allow alteration of body and facial structure, but that's not nearly as impressive as cutting hair.</description>
